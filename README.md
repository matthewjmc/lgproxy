The Telescope Looking Glass Proxy (LGProxy) is a high-performance, low-latency
remote desktop solution supporting both compressed and uncompressed streaming.
It uses our custom framebuffer relay library 
[libtrf](https://github.com/telescope-proj/libtrf), which supports both 
traditional TCP networks and high-performance RDMA networks.

To get started and learn more, head to our 
[documentation](https://telescope-proj.github.io/lgproxy/).
